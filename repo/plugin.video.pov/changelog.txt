- Fen, Venom, Mr-Kodi.
- elfhosted.com for community instances.

- torrentio debrid+ in My Services, sourced from torrentio results with RD+/AD+ tag.
- mediafusion debrid+ in My Services, sourced from mediafusion results with debrid token.
- nyaaio in Sources/Torrents, sourced from torrentio anime results with filters disabled.
- nyaa in Sources/Torrents sourced from website results.

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 4.12[/B][/COLOR]
- Rewrite tb_cloud scaper to include completed TorBox usenet.
  If reporting an issue, include screenshot of TorBox website from the "download" option
  for the item (which should include the item name and file list).
- Minor refactoring for each debrid, report anything that I might have broke.
- Changed Mediafusion Debrid+ Configure for easier set up.
  Authorize your debrid service first, 3 modes are offered.
  1. Select No to use Direct Torrent setting.  The cached status of direct torrents is unchecked.
  2. Select Yes and enter the base url (or use the default), then be prompted for which
  debrid service to use.  Only "cached" results will be returned.
  3. Select Yes and enter the complete manifest url and the addon will parse the required
  parts for configuration.
- Changed Real Debrid/All Debrid integration.
  Only two sources that will return results, `torrentio debrid+` and `mediafusion debrid+`.
  This relies on the `torrentio` and `mediafusion` internal caches, so there is a little
  logic and the chance of it being cached is high.  If you only have either debrid, disable
  all others OR enable "display uncached" and manually add those to cloud to view from there.
- Changed `nyaaio` scraper to include more of the foreign language sources from torrentio
  and disabled title check.
- Added completed TorBox usenet to Torbox Cloud Storage.
  Playback links from TorBox are still problematic.  Check the kodi.log before complaints
  the addon does not work.
- Added TorBox "Add Resovled Torrents to Cloud".
  This is disabled by default for consistency with other debrid services.  Disabled means
  that after receiving a resolved link from the service, the torrent will be deleted from
  the users cloud.
- Fix for TorBox Cloud Storage.  Thanks Reddit/Discord users!
- Fixed All Debrid no results.  Clear External Scrapers Cache after switching debrid provider.
- EXPERIMENTAL: changed Full-Screen playback window, if errors occur change setting
  Playback/Loading Progress to Background.  One service in particular seems to cause
  kodi to "freeze", causing pause in the animation.
- [COLOR chartreuse]Added EasyDebrid as a debrid provider.[/COLOR]
- Added zilean.
- Changed mediafusion to "Direct Torrent" only.

- Added small Anime menu courtesy of Simkl.  From root context menu, Edit and
  "Restore" menu or "Check" menu for new items.
- Changed request timeout for Real Debrid because random items like "The Office (US)" take
  30+ sec to complete.  For this to work, the setting Results/Scraper Timeout also needs
  to be increased to 30+ sec.  Thanks to insight from comment in Venom source code.
- Added "Disable" as option for "Jump To... List Navigation."

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 4.05[/B][/COLOR]

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 4.02[/B][/COLOR]
- Fixed Autoplay Next Expisode.
- Added "Autoscrape Next Episode (source select)."  There will be no window, but
  this setting uses the same activation parameters as "Auto Play / Autoplay Next Episode."
  Leave those as default or enable the setting and customize, but be sure to then
  disable "Auto Play / Autoplay Next Episode" as those settings will take precedence.
- Added "Clear Cloud Storage" for Offcloud.
- Changed bitsearch scraper to request one page with limit=50 rather than two requests
  with default page limit=~20.
- Added bitsearch sort preference for "random/largest" available.
  Ostensibly, one could have only bitsearch enabled and return a greater variety of
  4k,1080,720,SD results rather than mostly 4k results.

- Added meta_language iso:ar-SA, name:Arabic Saudi Arabia.

  does not provide file metadata, do not report zero size files.

- Disabled playback for certain file types from Offcloud because their api is not friendly.

  i.e. "The Essential X-Files Episodes" and "Star Wars Canon timeline."[/COLOR]

  change it to a reasonable amount for your device and then disable it. Even if disabled,
  POV will use this nominal value to limit the number of threads used when creating lists.

  Mixed lists have only been tested with the Trending/Popular/Search lists.

- Added more Kodi 20 Nexus changes.

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.01[/B][/COLOR]
- Added rudimentary fix for Kodi 20 Nexus release, incomplete but will cut down some of the
  warning messages. Tested only with Kodi 19.5/20 in Windows 10. New requirements seem
  over-engineered, but people are desperate for 1000s list items so it is apparently needed
  for speed improvement. Same goes for new settings format.

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.0[/B][/COLOR]
- Added support for TMDb logos when "Include Extra Art" turned off.
- Changed dialog sizes/colors. If alignment is off, check with default Kodi skin

- Moved to "traktcache2.db" in preparation for certain Trakt changes. "traktcache.db" can be deleted if you want. Doesn't matter either way.

- A couple more quick fixes.

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.6.04[/B][/COLOR]
- Needed to change a user_data folder name for "caches" because OpenWizard arbitrarily scans users' Kodi filesystem and deletes folders named a certain way. Unbelievable.

  [COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.6.03/04[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Most Watched This Week" by request to Movies and TV Shows menus. Restore these menus to default to view the new item in each.

- Unfortunately, another partial re-write of sources code due to an error I discovered after the previous update.

- Added setting "Use as Default Provider (Slow)" for Settings->Metadata->Include Extra Art. This will make Fen get all art from Fanart.tv instead of TMDb when possible.

Subsequent enabling/disabling of this setting will NOT need a clearing of the metadata database.
- Extended autoplay next episode seconds from end setting to up to 120 seconds.
- Some structural changes within the addon. So if you notice weird happenings, report them on the github.

- MANY settings/features removed for this update. Roll back to previous version and turn off auto updates if this is an issue. Or of course use a different addon.
- Changed "Filter Results By Size". Now you set your internet line speed rather than a min/max setting. Fen will determine on a per scrape basis the maximum filesize to include based on your internet speed and the reported duration of the movie/tvshow. There is now no way to set a minimum size.
e.g. If you input 20 Mbit/s as your internet speed, Fen will use the max speeds for different length videos as follows:
Length 10min = ~1.35 Gig, Length 30mins = ~4 Gig, Length 60 mins = ~8 Gig, Length 90min = ~12.5 Gig, Length 120min = ~16.2 Gig etc...
Fen will calculate these sizes using 90% of your overall internet speed (the amount you enter in settings).
- Added setting to have Fen scrape using ALL Fenomscraper scrapers instead of just the ones currently set to be used. If you get no results on a scraper search, you can select this to run a scrape with all the scrapers Fenomscrapers has. You can choose to do this from the "Options..." context menu.
- Added setting to enable/disable the Autoplay Next Episode window, if set to OFF you only receive a brief notification when the next episode is ready to be played. Found in Settings->Playback->Episodes->"Show Next Episode Window". Default is ON.
- Fixed Next Episode error in certain circumstances.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Trailer playback from Widgets with auto-open Extras enabled will now play in Kodi's default player window, meaning it won't crash Kodi anymore. Unfortunately, it also means Fen's skinned videoplayer window will not be used. I am still searching for a better solution to this problem.
