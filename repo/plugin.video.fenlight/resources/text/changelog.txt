NOTE: THERE ARE NO FIXES IN THIS RELEASE FOR REAL DEBRID INTEGRATION.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.93[/B][/COLOR]
- Couple of quick fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.92[/B][/COLOR]
- [CONTEXT MENU->OPTIONS->ASSIGN AN EPISODE GROUP TO...] Added option for TV Shows to assign an episode group from TMDb. These episode groups cover alternate season and episode orders based on other parameters. For example, it might be possible to set the episode order for a TV Show based on it's streaming aired order, or it's order from another service such as TVDb. These Custom Episode Groups will not change how the episodes are arranged within Fen Light, rather the information from them will be used when scraping for results for playback. This feature may be particularly useful when dealing with Anime content, but can be set for any TV Show.
- Added Settings->Results->General->"Retry With Custom Episode Group When No Results". Enable this and Fen Light will rescrape using a custom episode group if no results are found. If a custom episode group is already assigned to the TV Show (above for details), then a rescrape will occur using instead the default season/episode values instead.
- Added Settings->General->General->"Limit Concurrent Threads". Use this if your device is erroring by not allowing python to start new threads once a certain threshold is reached. There is a hard limit of 60 if this is not enabled and set to a user preference. Min/max settings are 10/300.
- Temporary workaround for the RD "no cached results" error currently randomly affecting calls to check RD's cache. Will be removed once their API is fixed for this endpoint.
- Fixed "Parental Guide" in Extras window. To get fresh results (empty results are cached), clear IMDb Database and restart Kodi.
- Improved trailer choice for metadata. Clear metadata cache for benefits.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.90/91[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering->"Custom Autoplay Sort To Top". This will allow you to set 5 different video/audio characteristics that you wish to see brought to the top of the sources list for autoplay. Things like "HEVC" or "DOLBY VISION" etc. These will be weighted on importance, with the higher the position in the list of 5 the higher the importance when sorting to the top.
- As a result, the other filtering options which previously featured an "INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, PREFER (AUTOPLAY)" setting have been reset, and the "PREFER (AUTOPLAY)" option has been removed.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Added Settings->Content->General->"Seeds used for Because You Watched Random". Choose how much previously watched media is used for recommendations for the Because You Watched Random menu. You can choose from the previous 1 to 5 watched items as the list from which the seed will be added.
- Partial fix for Parental Guidance in Extras window. IMDb look to be in the process of changing this on their website, so if the new layout loads, it will still not work. Clear Main Cache to clear any null values for this.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.83/84[/B][/COLOR]
- Added a favorites entry for Anime. All shows favorited from within the Anime section will be saved as an Anime favorite, rather than a TV Show favorite.

- Added Settings->Content->General->"Watched (Still Airing) TV Shows Location". Select from "Watched", "In Progress" or "Both". This decides which menu fully watched, but still airing, TV Shows will be included in. Default is "Watched" (which is the current behavior).

If you use "random" widgets (made using the various methods in Fen Light) then you will need to set a value here or else the random widgets will only show fresh random content on each Kodi start.
